## Work Experience

### Operations Engineer, [Brock Solutions](http://brocksolutions.com) — 2025–Present — San Francisco, CA

- Relocated to SFO to support deployment, integration, and validation of real-time baggage sortation software in a live airport environment  
- Integrated Brock software with industrial PLCs, scanners, scales, cameras, motors, and control hardware from multiple OEMs; validated system behavior using SCADA/HMI tooling  
- Developed Python-based data analysis and test scripts to evaluate long-term system performance, detect failure modes, and generate actionable insights for airport operations teams  
- Served as technical interface between software, hardware vendors, manufacturing and installation teams, and airport operations; led root-cause investigations to resolution  
- Coordinated with Brock’s off-site technical support team, prioritizing reliability, uptime, and safety in a 24/7 operational environment  

### Software Engineer, [Brock Solutions](http://brocksolutions.com) — 2023–2025 — Vancouver, BC

- Full-stack developer on a net-new, client-facing customs clearance software suite using C#, React, and MS SQL Server  
- Led a system upgrade and integration effort at YYC Airport, validating new software against existing baggage-handling control systems under tight operational timelines  
- Designed and deployed a Docker-based distributed microservices architecture in Azure; managed infrastructure as code using Terraform  
- Built automated tests and validation workflows as part of a modern CI/CD pipeline using GitHub  
- Mentored junior developers through pair programming and code reviews while practicing test-driven development  
- Contributed to and modernized a large legacy C# codebase while developing deep domain expertise  

### Software Co-op, [Sanctuary AI](https://www.sanctuary.ai) — 2022 — Vancouver, BC

- Developed and tested software components for a ROS-based humanoid robot using Python and C++, with a focus on physics simulation  
- Created automated scripts and quantitative metrics to evaluate sensor visualization, object tracking, and dexterous manipulation  
- Collaborated closely with robotics, controls, and hardware teams to debug simulation-to-real discrepancies  

### Embedded Systems Co-op, [Voltsafe](https://voltsafe.com) — 2020 — Vancouver, BC

- Developed embedded C++ firmware for an ESP32-based Bluetooth-enabled IoT product deployed in consumer environments  
- Designed and deployed a Linux-hosted user authentication service, including a NoSQL database and Python-based backend services  

### Mechatronics Co-op, [CARIS Robotics Lab](http://caris.mech.ubc.ca) — 2019 — Vancouver, BC

- Developed a Python-based [machine learning and testing framework](https://github.com/KeenanMcConkey/Wheelchair-Terrain-Classification) for real-time terrain classification in assistive robotics  
- Integrated ML software with physical sensors and actuators; validated performance across varied environmental and operating conditions  

### Engineering Intern, [Max Planck Institute](https://www.mpsd.mpg.de/en) — 2018 — Hamburg, Germany

- Conducted experimental work in electron-gun imaging at the Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter  
- Developed Python software to control experimental equipment and designed mechanical components for experimental systems  

## Education
